  <h2> Fortnite:</h2>
  <p>&#34 Fortnite&#34 was published by North Carolina-based studio Epic Games and released in &#34early access&#34 form last summer. That means it&#8242s technically still in development, even though you can purchase it now for $59.99. The game is what&#8242s known as an open-world survival game, in which players collect resources, make tools and weapons, and try to stay alive as long as possible.<br>
  The game is set on modern-day Earth, but most of humanity has disappeared. One of the game&#8242s core mechanics is collecting materials to build protective fortifications.<br>
  A few months after its initial launch, Epic Games dropped &#34Fortnite Battle Royale,&#34 a free mode using assets and gameplay elements from the main game in which 100 people square off against each other in a fight for survival, with the last living player crowned the winner.<br>
  This is when &#34Fortnite&#34 really started to take off ,10 million people were playing within weeks of its release. The battle royale mode is what remains incredibly popular and what most people are talking about when they talk about &#34Fortnite.&#34<br>

    <h2> Types of music:</h2>
<p>
    <h3> Pop</h3>
    Pop music is the genre of popular music that produces the most hits. A hit is a song that sells many copies, and the latest hits are listed every week on the charts. To get on the charts, a song must be released as a single, although most singles are also released on an album. Songs that become hits almost always share certain features that are sometimes called the pop-music formula. They have a good rhythm, a catchy melody, and are easy to remember and sing along to. They usually have a chorus that&#8242s repeated several times and two or more verses. Most pop songs are between two and five minutes long, and the lyrics are usually about the joys and problems of love and relationships. Pop songs are produced by groups like the boy band One Direction and the girl group Girls' Generation, and by pop singers like Justin Bieber and Madonna.
    <h3> Rock</h3>
    Rock music has been a volatile, unpredictable creature that has constantly redefined and reinvented itself since its emergence in the late 1940s. Not surprisingly, then, it can be extremely difficult to apply a straightforward definition to such a restless musical format.But while people might quibble over specifics, rock music can generally be described as hard-edged music performed with electric guitars, bass, and drums and usually accompanied by lyrics sung by a vocalist.That sounds simple enough, but a closer look at the evolution of rock suggests how different styles and influences have shaped its development over the years. First, a look back at its foundations.
    <h3> Rap</h3>
    Rap is a vocal technique, while hip-hop is a subculture. Rap only makes up one part of hip-hop, so the two terms are not interchangeable. Afrika Bambaataa was one of the most important figures in the early development of hip-hop and articulated the four elements that made up the subculture: DJing, b-boying (also known as breakdancing), graffiti writing, and MCing. Rapping is another word for MCing.<br>
    Rappers became the most visible and marketable proponents of hip-hop in the 1980s. For this reason, they came to represent the subculture as a whole in the minds of some people. Although many people familiar with hip-hop music in the 21st century may assume that rap is the most important pillar of hip-hop, in the early days of the subculture, the other pillars were perhaps even more critical.
    <h3> Country</h3>
    Country music, also called country and western, style of American popular music that originated in rural areas of the South and West in the early 20th century. The term country and western music (later shortened to country music) was adopted by the recording industry in 1949 to replace the derogatory label hillbilly music.<br>
    Ultimately, country music&#8242s roots lie in the ballads, folk songs, and popular songs of the English, Scots, and Irish settlers of the Appalachians and other parts of the South. In the early 1920s the traditional string-band music of the Southern mountain regions began to be commercially recorded, with Fiddlin&#8242 John Carson garnering the genre&#8242s first hit record in 1923. The vigour and realism of the rural songs, many lyrics of which were rather impersonal narratives of tragedies pointing to a stern Calvinist moral, stood in marked contrast to the often mawkish sentimentality of much of the popular music of the day

    <p>Golden Retrievers are highly intelligent and social animals that require exercise and mental stimulation to avoid boredom and resulting behavioral problems and hyperactivity. Most Goldens love swimming-related activities, playing fetch, and even playing hide and seek. This is an activity that mimics search and rescue activities. Don not forget to reward your pet with high praise or small treats when he finds you! If these activities are not possible for you on a regular basis, a long walk or a brisk run will help keep your Golden Retriever happy.</p>
    <h3>Golden Retriever facts!</h3>
<p>
<ol> <li> A short history: Golden&#8242s were first bred from Scotland in the mid 19th century. This breed was developed as a hunting breed. They first came to North America in the 1920&#8242s where they became popular for their excellent temperament and beautiful appearance. In 1925, the AKC (American Kennel Club) registered the golden retriever as a breed.</li> <br>

<li> The golden retriever is a crossbreed. The breed originates from a Tweed Water Spaniel, which is an extinct breed nowadays, and a Yellow Flat Coated Retriever. This was done back in the 1800&#8242s.</li><br>

<li>Golden retrievers have a very high tolerance to pain and can tolerate injuries that many other dogs canâ€™t tolerate. That is part of why they make very good rescuers, police and hunting helpers.</li><br>

<li>As the dog ages, his fur will darken. It&#8242s possible to know exactly what colour the newborn pup will have when he is an adult by looking at the colour at the tip of his ears.</li><br>

<li>Retrievers are prone to health problems like hip dysplasia, eye problems and epilepsy.</li><br>

<li>Golden&#8242s are incredible swimmers. Their large webbing between the toes and long tail to aid in steering makes them water-based dogs.</li><br>

<li>Owning a golden retriever can cost you $13,000 over his lifetime considering he will live 10 years.</li><br>

<li>Do you know any famous golden retrievers? There was Buddy from the movie Air Bud, Shadow from Homeward Bound and the President Gerald Ford&#8242s dog named Liberty.</li><br>

<li>This breed has 2 layers of fur. The inner layer is to keep warm and the outer layer is waterproof.</li></p>
